                            <p>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                                &lt;<a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>
                            <p>
                                Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                                of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

                            <h4 id="preamble">Preamble</h4>

                            <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
                                software and other kinds of works.</p>

                            <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
                                to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
                                the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
                                share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
                                software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
                                GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
                                any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
                                your programs, too.</p>

                            <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                                price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                                have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                                them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
                                want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
                                free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

                            <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
                                these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
                                certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
                                you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

                            <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                                gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
                                freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
                                or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
                                know their rights.</p>

                            <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
                                (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
                                giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

                            <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
                                that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
                                authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
                                changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
                                authors of previous versions.</p>

                            <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
                                modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
                                can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
                                protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
                                pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
                                use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
                                have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
                                products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
                                stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
                                of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

                            <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
                                States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
                                software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
                                avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
                                make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
                                patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

                            <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                                modification follow.</p>

                            <h5 id="section0">0. Definitions.</h5>

                            <p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

                            <p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
                                works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>

                            <p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
                                License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
                                “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>

                            <p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
                                in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
                                exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
                                earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>

                            <p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
                                on the Program.</p>

                            <p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
                                permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
                                infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
                                computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
                                distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
                                public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

                            <p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
                                parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
                                a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

                            <p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
                                to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
                                feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
                                tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
                                extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
                                work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
                                the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
                                menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

                            <h5 id="section1">1. Source Code.</h5>

                            <p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
                                for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source
                                form of a work.</p>

                            <p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
                                standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
                                interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
                                is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

                            <p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
                                than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
                                packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
                                Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
                                Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
                                implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
                                “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
                                (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
                                (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
                                produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

                            <p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
                                the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
                                work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
                                control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
                                System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
                                programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
                                which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
                                includes interface definition files associated with source files for
                                the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
                                linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
                                such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
                                subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

                            <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
                                can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
                                Source.</p>

                            <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
                                same work.</p>

                            <h5 id="section2">2. Basic Permissions.</h5>

                            <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
                                copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated

                                permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
                                covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
                                content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
                                rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

                            <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
                                convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
                                in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
                                of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
                                with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
                                the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
                                not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
                                for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
                                and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
                                your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

                            <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
                                the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
                                makes it unnecessary.</p>

                            <h5 id="section3">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h5>

                            <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
                                measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
                                11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
                                similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
                                measures.</p>

                            <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
                                circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
                                is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
                                the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
                                modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
                                users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
                                technological measures.</p>

                            <h5 id="section4">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h5>

                            <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
                                receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
                                appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
                                keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
                                non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
                                keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
                                recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

                            <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
                                and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

                            <h5 id="section5">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h5>

                            <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
                                produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
                                terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
                                    it, and giving a relevant date.</li>

                                <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
                                    released under this License and any conditions added under section
                                    7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
                                    “keep intact all notices”.</li>

                                <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
                                    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
                                    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
                                    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
                                    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
                                    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
                                    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

                                <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
                                    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
                                    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
                                    work need not make them do so.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
                                works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
                                and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
                                in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
                                “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
                                used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
                                beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
                                in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
                                parts of the aggregate.</p>

                            <h5 id="section6">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h5>

                            <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
                                of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
                                machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
                                in one of these ways:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                                    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
                                    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
                                    customarily used for software interchange.</li>

                                <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                                    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
                                    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
                                    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
                                    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
                                    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
                                    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
                                    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
                                    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
                                    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
                                    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

                                <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
                                    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
                                    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
                                    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
                                    with subsection 6b.</li>

                                <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
                                    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
                                    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
                                    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
                                    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
                                    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
                                    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
                                    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
                                    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
                                    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
                                    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
                                    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

                                <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
                                    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
                                    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
                                    charge under subsection 6d.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
                                from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
                                included in conveying the object code work.</p>

                            <p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
                                tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
                                or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
                                into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
                                doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
                                product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a
                                typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
                                of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
                                actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
                                is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
                                commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
                                the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

                            <p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
                                procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
                                and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
                                a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
                                suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
                                code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
                                modification has been made.</p>

                            <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
                                specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
                                part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
                                User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
                                fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
                                Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
                                by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
                                if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
                                modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
                                been installed in ROM).</p>

                            <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
                                requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
                                for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
                                the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
                                network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
                                adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
                                protocols for communication across the network.</p>

                            <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
                                in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
                                documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
                                source code form), and must require no special password or key for
                                unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

                            <h5 id="section7">7. Additional Terms.</h5>

                            <p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
                                License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
                                Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
                                be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
                                that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
                                apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
                                under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
                                this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

                            <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
                                remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
                                it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
                                removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
                                additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
                                for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

                            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
                                add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
                                that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
                                    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

                                <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
                                    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
                                    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

                                <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
                                    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
                                    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

                                <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
                                    authors of the material; or</li>

                                <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
                                    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

                                <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
                                    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
                                    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
                                    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
                                    those licensors and authors.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
                                restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
                                received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
                                governed by this License along with a term that is a further
                                restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
                                a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
                                License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
                                of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
                                not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

                            <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
                                must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
                                additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
                                where to find the applicable terms.</p>

                            <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
                                form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
                                the above requirements apply either way.</p>

                            <h5 id="section8">8. Termination.</h5>

                            <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
                                provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
                                modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
                                this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
                                paragraph of section 11).</p>

                            <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
                                license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
                                provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
                                finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
                                holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
                                prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

                            <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
                                reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
                                violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
                                received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
                                copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
                                your receipt of the notice.</p>

                            <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
                                licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
                                this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                                reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
                                material under section 10.</p>

                            <h5 id="section9">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h5>

                            <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
                                run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
                                occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
                                to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
                                nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
                                modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
                                not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
                                covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

                            <h5 id="section10">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h5>

                            <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
                                receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
                                propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
                                for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

                            <p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
                                organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
                                organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
                                work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
                                transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
                                licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
                                give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
                                Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
                                the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

                            <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
                                rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
                                not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
                                rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
                                (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
                                any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
                                sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

                            <h5 id="section11">11. Patents.</h5>

                            <p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
                                License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
                                work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.</p>

                            <p>A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
                                owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
                                hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
                                by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
                                but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
                                consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
                                purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
                                patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
                                this License.</p>

                            <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
                                patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
                                make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
                                propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

                            <p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
                                agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
                                (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
                                sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a
                                party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
                                patent against the party.</p>

                            <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
                                and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
                                to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
                                publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
                                then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
                                available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
                                patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
                                consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
                                license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have
                                actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
                                covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
                                in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
                                country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>

                            <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
                                arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
                                covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
                                receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
                                or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
                                you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
                                work and works based on it.</p>

                            <p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
                                the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
                                conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
                                specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
                                work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
                                in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
                                to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
                                the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
                                parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
                                patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
                                conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
                                for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
                                contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
                                or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

                            <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
                                any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
                                otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

                            <h5 id="section12">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h5>

                            <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                                excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
                                covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
                                not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
                                to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
                                the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
                                License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

                            <h5 id="section13">13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h5>

                            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
                                permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
                                under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
                                combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
                                License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
                                but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
                                section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
                                combination as such.</p>

                            <h5 id="section14">14. Revised Versions of this License.</h5>

                            <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
                                the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
                                be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                                address new problems or concerns.</p>

                            <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
                                Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
                                Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the

                                public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
                                to choose that version for the Program.</p>

                            <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
                                permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
                                author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
                                later version.</p>

                            <h4 id="howto">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h4>

                            <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                                possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                                free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

                            <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
                                to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                                state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                                the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

                            <pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

                            <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
                                notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

                            <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate

                                might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.</p>

                            <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
